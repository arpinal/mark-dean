    <h1>Mark Dean</h1>
    <h3>Mark Dean is a computer engineer who co-invented the ISA bus, and was a leader in the development of the color PC monitor and the first gigahertz chip.  He holds three of nine PC patents for being the co-creator of the IBM personal computer released in 1981. In 1995, Dean was named the first ever African-American IBM Fellow. As a child, Dean often accompanied his father on work trips and eventually became fascinated with dam engineering. He and his father once built a tractor from scratch, and Dean's grandfather was a high school principal. His family always nurtured his thirst for knowledge, specifically in math and science. </h3>
